Polar decomposition
======================

Eigen or also spectral decomposition of the second order tensor :math:`\SecondT{X}` is given as

.. math::

    \SecondT{X} = \sum_{i=0}^n \lambda_i \textbf{E}_i


where :math:`\lambda_i` are the eigenvalues and :math:`\textbf{E}_i` is the corresponding eigen basis.
